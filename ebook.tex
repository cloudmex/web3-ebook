\begin{quote}
I've developed a new open source P2P e-cash system called Bitcoin. It's completely decentralized, with no central server or trusted parties, because everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust. The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work.\\
--Satoshi Nakamoto
\end{quote}

Web 3 will not solve the problems of the whole world. Is not a magic wand that will cure all sickness. But is an alternative, and in a moment of crisis having alternatives is gold.

In January of 2009 Bitcoin\footnote{A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System} was borned. Just after the real state market crash of 2008. Bitcoin is an alternative to money.

In 2015, smart contracts were borned in ethereum. Smart contracts are computer software distributed among a blockchain network. These are an alternative to computing.

This books is started to being written in June, 2022. Pretends to cover the main projects around Web 3 and have it like a concept reference. At this moment there are 9,912 crypto projects being listed on CoinMarketCap\footnote{Website to know market capitalization of each crypto token.}. We \textbf{try} to cover some of the more iconic projects being builded over the Web 3.0 world space.

\chapter{Escaping from Web 2.0}

During the first 15 years of the 2000 millenium there was a giant race to build Web 2. Great achievements were done like social networks and E-Commerce. But all of these had a big price: Your data.

But more than that, it was the way Web 2.0 take advantage of this. This means lots of publicity being targeted to yourself.

\textit{Cambridge Analytica} is probably one the most unsane escenarios that we could live on Web 2. This was personal data being stolen from Facebook in order to sold marketing that benefits Donald Trump campaing. A direct attack to a fair democracy. This is not the only case around the world.

\textbf{What is not Web 3}

If you has been away of the blockchain ecosystem Web 3 will be a new world to you.

Centralized databases does not exist. As Mongodb or MariaDB. Instead we use a distributed ledger called blockchain. 

The most importanto to myself: Is not a fashion. Web 3.0 is here to stay. Living together with Web 2.0 technologies. Solving its own problems.

\chapter{Rupunzel}

There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a child. At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire. These people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had great power and was dreaded by all the world. One day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and asked: `What ails you, dear wife?' `Ah,' she replied, `if I can't eat some of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall die.' 

Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a little window. When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself beneath it and cried:

'Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
Let down your hair to me.'

Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress climbed up to her. `If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too will try my fortune,' said he, and the next day when it began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried:

'Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
Let down your hair to me.'

Immediately the hair fell down and the king's son climbed up.

'Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
Let down your hair to me.'

she let the hair down. The king's son ascended, but instead of finding his dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with wicked and venomous looks. `Aha!' she cried mockingly, 'you would fetch your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest;
